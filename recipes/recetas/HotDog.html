  <p class="espacios">The hot dog is a food in the form of a sandwich that is generated with the combination of a boiled Frankfurt or Viennese sausage.</p>

  <p class="espacios"> Hot dogs come in all shapes and sizes! From the classic all-beef frankfurter to regional specialties like the Chicago-style dog (dragged through the garden!), there's a hot dog out there for everyone. Hot dogs are endlessly customizable with a variety of toppings and condiments. Ketchup, mustard, and relish are the classics, but you can get adventurous with sauerkraut, kimchi, sriracha, and even pineapple (if you dare!).</p>

  <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Meat: This is usually a combination of trimmings from various cuts of beef, pork, or even poultry. Higher quality hot dogs will list specific cuts of meat, like beef chuck.
  </li>
  
  <li>Seasonings: This is where the magic happens! Salt, pepper, garlic, onion, and paprika are common, but other spices can be included depending on the brand's recipe.
  </li>

  <li> Preservatives: These help to extend the shelf life of hot dogs. Sodium nitrite is a common one, but there may be others </li>

  <li>Fillers: Some hot dogs may include fillers, like breadcrumbs or cereal, to extend the volume or reduce cost.
  </li>

</ul>
