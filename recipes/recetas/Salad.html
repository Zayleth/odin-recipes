<h2>SALAD ðŸ¥— </h2>
<p class="espacios">A Caesar salad is a salad of romaine lettuce, chopped chicken breast, and croÃ»tons with lemon juice, olive oil, egg, Worcestershire sauce, anchovies, garlic, Dijon mustard, Parmesan cheese, and black pepper.</p>

<p class="espacios">In Mexican restaurants this salad is generally prepared for two people, in front of the diners; although the recipes vary; The usual thing is to spread the salad bowl with garlic and prepare the dressing there with anchovies, raw egg yolks, lemon juice, salt, pepper, seasoning juice, Worcestershire sauce and, sometimes, mustard. Whole leaves of dried apricot lettuce are mixed with this dressing, then served on the plate arranged lengthwise, garnished with Melba-type croutons and sprinkled with Parmesan cheese. Although the ingredients and quantities vary, the Caesar salad service does not present major changes.
